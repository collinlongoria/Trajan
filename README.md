## üß† About
**Trajan** is a game engine library that is modular and easy to start.  
**Why another engine?** The main goal of Trajan is to support developers with an optional editor and an clear and easy to use library, for those that don't want an editor, or want to use their own! Trajan also supports api-agnostic rendering. In short, **Trajan's goal is to let you do whatever you want**.

**Status:** alpha. Currently many features, including all of the editor, are missing/unstable.

**Production use:** no (although, everything existing is production/memory safe, etc.)

## ‚ùì FAQ
**Q:** Does Trajan support OpenGL/Vulkan/Metal/etc.?  
**A:** Trajan is api-agnostic in it's renderer. Currently, OpenGL 4.6 and Vulkan 1.4 have implemented renderers. More support for other renderers are planned. You can also implement your own.

**Q:** Is hot-reload supported?  
**A:** Not currently. This is a planned feature.

**Q:** Can I make commercial games with it?  
**A:** Let me figure out lisence stuff first. Need to make sure you credit libraries used by Trajan. Credit Trajan itself if you want.

<!--
## üß© Troubleshooting
- **Nothing renders / blank window**
  - Verify GPU drivers and backend selection (`--renderer=opengl`).
  - Check logs at `logs/engine.log`.
- **Vulkan validation errors**
  - Install correct Vulkan SDK; enable validation layers.
- **Build fails on Windows**
  - Use matching generator (`-G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`), run in Developer Prompt.

Add platform-specific gotchas you see often.
